Practical 4:
everything was fine. There were no improvements available for the formative feedback.

Practical 5:
About W should be true only if both X and Y are True, the feedback said that I haven't tested True and True as well as False and False. I add them now: 
X = True
Y = True
W = X and Y
print(W)

X = False
Y = False
W = X and Y
print(W)
I uploaded the revised code to the folder Practical5.
