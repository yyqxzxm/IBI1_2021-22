the question which I chose:
What proportion of cases have died (as of the latest information) in Germany? What proportion of cases have died in the UK?
The answer for Germany is on the 52nd line.
The answer for the UK is on the 61st line.

The death proportion in Germany was 0.009416439196937638
The death proportion in the UK was 0.06359243033286663
These results show that the severity of the COVID-19 in Germany was significantly less than that in the UK by March 31, 2020. The UK government needs to set up stricter epidemic prevention measures to protect people's lives and health.
